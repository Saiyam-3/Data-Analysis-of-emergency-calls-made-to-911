# Data-Analysis-of-emergency-calls-made-to-911
This data contains the latitude,longitude,city,zip code,type,time and date and the address of the particular 911 call made.
I analysed data to find the maximum type of emergenices in the city. I found the locations and types of emergenices that occured.
I found out the time when such emergenices would occur.
